<p><hr><p><a name='Trace Ray and Calculate Color'></a><h2>TraceRay</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For the first part of the assignment, I followed the provided
instructions to complete the <code>traceRay</code> and <code>calculateColor</code>
functions.</p>

<p><hr><p><a name='Triangle'></a><h2>Triangle</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing findIntersectionWithTriangle, I used the second explained method from
    lecture (Ray-Triangle Intersection II). First, I found out if the ray even interescts
    with the plane the triangle is on. If not, then theres not need to check if it intersects the 
    triangle itself. Next, I followed the given algorithm for each side of the triangle, finding
    out if the dot product of the ray.directoin and the cross product of the vectors
    of the point of intersection to the plane to the respective corners is less than zero.

    After testing this for all sides of the triangle, I set the out vector intersect's position and normal
    to the position and normal of the intersection point of the ray and the triangle. Finally,
    I returned the distance between the origin of the ray and the intersection point found.

<p><hr><p><a name='Sphere'></a><h2>Sphere</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing findIntersectionWithSphere, I used the explaination from lecture/precept. As the algorithm
    is despcribed, I first found the distance beteween the ray origin and the center of the sphere given (set as variable vec3 L),
    then took the dot product of such distance to the ray direction vector (variable float tca). If this dot product is less than 0, then no intersection
    exists. I then defined a dSquard, which is the distance squared subtracted by the previous dot product value squared, which 
    geometrically describes the length along the ray direction vector that is needed to be traversed until you are adjacent to the sphere
    origin. If this value is greater than the radius squared, then the ray does not intersect the sphere.
    Next, I defined the variable thc as the square root of the radius squared minus dSquared to get the distance between
    the point of intersection to the center of the sphere along the ray direction vector. 

    Finally, I defined two distances from the two points of intersection using tca - thc and tca + thc respectively. The shorter of the two distances
    corresponds to the nearest valid intersection point. I then used this point to define the 
    intersect's position and normal (normalized the position found minus the sphere's center position).

    This function returns the distance from the ray origin to the point of intersection and INFINITY if no such intersection exists.

<p><hr><p><a name='Box'></a><h2>Box</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing findIntersectionWithBox, I followed the algorithm described in lecture/precept. By treating each side of the box
    as its own plane, I was able to use findIntersectionWithPlane using the constraints of the given box (pmin and pmax). I defined an inBounds helper 
    function which allowed me to check if the found intersect point with the plane and ray is within the bounds of the given 
    box. THen, I used chooseCloserIntersection between the faces of the box to determine which intersection point was the closest to the ray's origin. 
    This distance (ray origin to intersection point) is returned if such intersection point exists and INFINITY is returned otherwise.

<p><hr><p><a name='Cone'></a><h2>Cone</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing getIntersectOpenCone, I had to also implement getIntersectDisc. These algorithms are defined in the A3 description on the site. 
    Firstly, with the cone intersection, I followed the given formula (each of my defined variables correspond to the ones described here): 
    <p>
        <img src='results/coneFormula.png'>
    </p>
    Next, I found the variable t by solving the quadratic formula using the values of a, b and c. Because the quadratic formula gives us two values,
    I had to test each t and choose the closest intersection point. A point interescts if the following relationship holds:
    <p>
        <img src='results/coneRelationship.png'>
    </p>
    Then, the interesect position is set to the closest found intersection point. The normal of the intersection is perpendicular to the 
    surface of the cone and found using this method:
    <p>
        <img src='results/coneNormal.png'>
    </p>

    Please note that since I implemented cone, there is a floating disc underneath the right sphere (I assume this is for cylinder which I did not implement).

        <img src='results/hardShadows.png'>
    </p>
</p>

<p><hr><p><a name='Shadows'></a><h2>Shadows</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing pointInShadow, I followed the description given in precept. Firstly, I defined
    a new Ray object which is a ray with an origin defined with the given position (pos) and a direction
    defined as the lightVec given (vector from position to light).

    I used rayIntersectScene to find the length of this ray, which would be a little less than the length of the
    lightVec itself if the given point is in the shadow. 

    <p>
        <img src='results/hardShadows.png'>
    </p>

</p>

<p><hr><p><a name='Soft+shadows'></a><h2>Soft shadows</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing softShadowRatio, I followed the description given in precept. First, 
    I calculated the sample size using the defined SOFT_SAMPLING variable. I also defined a variable pi equal
    to the digits of pi. I also defined a variable to keep count of how many points are in the shadow.

    I used the rand method found in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4200224/random-noise-functions-for-glsl
    which was found within the assignment details. By using this method, I was able to define a random noise variable
    (dependent on the current grid position) to map x to a random position within [0, 2pi) and map y to a random position 
    within [-1, 1). This gives us the intersect point for each point within the area as: 
    <p>
        <img src='results/softShadowsEquation.png'>
    </p>
    The ray (from point given to the randomly sampled point) direction is the offseted given lightVec (offseted by the intersect point found).
    If the length of this vector minus the distance between the ray and the intersect value equals 0, then the sampled point is in the shadow. 

    Finally, I returned the number of points in the shadow divided by the number of shadow rays (value of SOFT_SAMPLING), which is
    the fractional light contribution.

    Results with SOFT_SAMPLING = 3.0
    <p>
        <img src='results/softShadows3.png'>
    </p>

    Results with SOFT_SAMPLING = 25.0

    </p>
</p>

<p><hr><p><a name='Transmission'></a><h2>Transmission</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing calcReflectionVector, I followed described Snell's Law in lecture/precept. 
    <p>
        <img src='results/snell.png'>
    </p>
    Note that since the normal vector was already negated, I had to use the negated direction vector in my calculations.
    Transmission is implemented in all result images. 
</p>

<p><hr><p><a name='Checkerboard'></a><h2>Checkerboard</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing checkerboard, I followed described method in precept. Firstly, quantized each position value (x, y, z) 
    to a unit grid. Based on this, I returned the original material color if the point was in a "white" checkerboard
    box. If the point was in a "black" box, I calculated the average of the material's color at that point and divide
    the original material color by that average. To make it darker, I inverted the luminosity.

    </p>

</p>

<p><hr><p><a name='Phong+material'></a><h2>Phong material</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing phong, I followed described method in lecture/precept. 
    <p>
        <img src='results/phong.png'>
    </p>

    Phong is implemented in all result images. 
</p>

<p><hr><p><a name='Special+material'></a><h2>Special material</h2><p><hr><p>
<p>For implementing my special material, I used the rand method (as seen in soft shadows). 
    Since I was playing around with this method during my soft shadows implementation, I just used 
    a bit of code from there. I created a noise variable which contains three randomly floats based on 
    the three combinations of position values. I then multiplied each position value by their corresponding 
    noise value and divided the material's original color by (noise multiplied by average found). This value
    was picked arbitraily (I tested multiple combinations and this looks the most interesting in my opinion).
